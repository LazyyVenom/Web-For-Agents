# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-29)

### New

- `generateAgentFiles()` (from `@anubhav-choubey/web-for-agents/vite`) and the `web-for-agents generate <outDir>` CLI command. They add `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `.md` pages, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and `agents.json` to HTML you prerendered yourself, and link each page to its markdown. Vite is not needed.
- `prerender.fileLayout: "flat"` writes `/about` as `about.html` instead of `about/index.html`.
- `markdown.transform` rewrites each page's markdown before it is written to the `.md` file and `llms-full.txt`.
- `prerender.readySelector` and `prerender.onTimeout: "snapshot"` for pages that animate forever.
- Title and description length warnings: at build time (grouped by problem) and in development from `<Seo>` / `useSeo`. Limits: title at most 60 characters, description 50 to 160.

### Changed

- The CLI audit's title limit is now 60 characters (was 70), the same as the build and dev warnings. Titles of 61 to 70 characters now get a warning, which can lower existing scores.
- Attribute-only DOM changes (`class`, `style`, `aria-*`, `data-*`) no longer keep a page from counting as idle during prerendering.
- A route whose output file would be another route's file (`/index`, or `/200` in the flat layout) is skipped with a warning instead of overwriting it.
- Prerendering without vite installed fails with an install hint.

## 0.1.1 (2026-10-29)

- Fixed the `bin` entry so `npm publish` keeps the `web-for-agents` command.
- Short README, with the full reference under `docs/` (security, isolation and performance guidance added).
- The JSON-LD audit message uses the singular for one block.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-28)

First release: the Vite plugin (prerendering with happy-dom or Chrome, markdown pages, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `agents.json`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt` with an AI crawler policy), the React runtime (`<Seo>`, JSON-LD, content regions, agent actions with WebMCP), the dev overlay and the `web-for-agents audit` CLI.
